Title: RoboSpeaker - Text-to-Speech Conversion

Description:
RoboSpeaker is a simple Python mini project that allows users to convert text input into speech output. The program takes user input from the command line and converts it into an audible speech using the text-to-speech synthesis technique.

Key Features:

User Interaction: The program interacts with the user by prompting for input through the command line.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: It utilizes the pyttsx3 library on Windows to convert the user's text input into speech output.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: The code is modified to work on Windows, ensuring the program's usability across different operating systems.
Looping Functionality: The program continuously prompts the user for input until the user enters "q" to quit the program.
Usage:

Launch the program in your Python IDE or terminal.
Enter the desired text that you want the RoboSpeaker to convert into speech.
The program will convert the text into audible speech using the pyttsx3 library and play it.
Repeat the process to convert additional text or enter "q" to quit the program.
Benefits:

The RoboSpeaker mini project allows users to experiment with text-to-speech conversion and gain a better understanding of how to integrate such functionality into their own projects.
It demonstrates how to utilize the pyttsx3 library for cross-platform text-to-speech synthesis in Python.
Users can modify the code to incorporate additional features, such as saving the speech as an audio file or adjusting the speech rate and voice settings.
Overall, RoboSpeaker provides a simple yet practical demonstration of text-to-speech conversion, offering an accessible starting point for further exploration and development in the field of speech synthesis.
